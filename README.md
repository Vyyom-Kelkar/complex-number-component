# complex-number-component
This is a basic java component created for complex numbers. This project was part of my STEP program at the Ohio State University, and as such follows the OSU guidelines for creating and documenting software components. 

Development was done in Eclipse. File structure in the repo also follows the structure of the Eclipse project template used in Software I and Software II courses at OSU.

Feel free to fork and improve on the component!
